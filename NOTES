Story:

Accessible languages that solve real ("authentic") probelms is important because then we can croud source tasks like program generation, algorithm creation, etc.

We built a language and evaluated its accessibility and "authenticity".

We found that people could solve computational problems without realizing it.  And we found that people came up with creative solutions.

We leveraged this for program synthesis for sorting algorithms and were able to synthesize several different sorting algorithms.
